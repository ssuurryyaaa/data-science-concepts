# Data Science Interview Concepts

Welcome to the **Data Science Interview Concepts** repository! This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to help aspiring data scientists prepare for interviews by covering essential topics and common interview questions across different domains within data science.

## Repository Structure

The concepts are organized into key topics that frequently appear in data science interviews. Each topic folder contains explanations, examples, and practice questions for hands-on learning. This structure is designed to support both beginners and advanced practitioners in refreshing core concepts.
